Here are our goals:

Classes: Game/ Main - starts the game and creates 
	 Server Controller - can be clicked on to host a game or connect to a game.
	 Game Menu - That triangle in the corner can do a lot.

	 Edit Screen - makes the grid and makes it editable and zoomable
	 Pixel Map - holds the pixel arrays
	 Dialog Box - does many things including the most-important loading box

	 Player - moves in game
	 Pixel Group - used to represent the pixels in game.
